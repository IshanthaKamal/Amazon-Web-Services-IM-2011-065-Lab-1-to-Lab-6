# Amazon-Web-Services-IM-2011-065-Lab-1-to-Lab-6

I refered the Cloud Academy web site and study about the lab sessions regarding AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate module.

Lab 1 - Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Linux)

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. EC2 provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes. This allows you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 allows you to build and configure your instances as you like, from your operating system to your applications.

Lab 2 - Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Winodows)

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. With Amazon EC2 it is possible to create new servers in a few minutes and use different images (AMI) to personalize them. AWS provides several Microsoft Windows Server AMIs that enables to run any compatible Windows-based solution. Users can use Windows-based applications, websites, and web-services written in .NET, for data processing, media trans-coding, and any other task requiring Windows software.

Lab 3 - Managing instance volume Using EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run workloads.

Lab 4 - Create your first Amazon S3 bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Users will pay only for the storage actually use with no minimum fee and no setup cost. It can be used alone, or together with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Glacier.

Lab 5 - Create an EBS-Backed (Linux AMI)

Elastic Load Balancing allows the distribution of incoming traffic to Amazon AWS infrastructure across multiple instances. This represents a great tool in avoiding failures in applications and web traffic. ELB automatically detects fails in EC2 instances and redirects traffic to other available instances. During this lab users will learn to create and use first ELB instance to balance the HTTP traffic between two EC2 instances.

Lab 6 - Create your first Amazon RDS Database

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Users can migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database to the Amazon Web Services because Amazon RDS offers access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and the PostgreSQL database engine. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. This efficiency frees to focus on applications and business.
